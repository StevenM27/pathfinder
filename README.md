# Pathfinding Visualization

## Overview
I decided to polish up my Python skills by creating this project. I have some experience with pygame, so I ended up using it to create the GUI.

## Instructions
- Run main.py
- Left-click mouse once to place the start point
- Left-click again to place the end point
- Any left-clicks while the start and end points are both on the grid will place barriers instead
- Remove a start, end, or barrier by right-clicking them
- "R" key to reset the grid
- "M" key to generate a maze
- "D" key for Dijkstra's algorithm
- "A" key for A* algorithm
